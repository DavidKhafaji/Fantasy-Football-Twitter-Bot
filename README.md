My fantasy football twitter bot, made with Python and JS! 

The bot itself uses the python Library 'Tweepy' to access the Twitter API. Thanks to Twitter's functionality with developer mode, I was able to set up API access using an 'authtoken' for my bot.

The bot collects each score from our fantasy football league, and tweets out results weekly; using team name and score.
