# Fantasy Football Bot Readme
This fantasy football bot was created using Tweepy. With Tweepy, we connect to Twitters library, calling a simple API and creating a function.


Upon creating the ESPNBot, I knew I'd need to find a /login page in order to scrape data from my fantasy football league, such as ID "1234567". ESPN's fantasy football page doesn't have a /login URL, so it turns out when typing in credentials wrong, this prompts a S22 key in the console; which connects my bot to the website.
